Explanation and commentary: <br/>

I wanted to know how to create an animation. <br/>
So I figured I had to learn the DemoScene. <br/>
In just 2-3 days, I produced this very short extract. <br/>

Here is a preview ! <br/>

A function in the code allows you to pause the animation.
If the mouse click and then activate the animation will play.

Have Fun and Enjoy! <br/>
